* Campus map page loads map of school, grabs your location periodically, and does autocompletion.
Needs to place markers on the map. Implement pathing (source->destination), if possible.
* Implement [Android-RSS](https://github.com/ahorn/android-rss) to grab the feeds.
Have a tabbed interface to move between feeds a la Google+ app.
* Implement important links. Simplicity with information is the goal.
* Implement Directory (STRETCH). This is fairly uninteresting, so it will probably be scrapped.
